In order to use this script you should register a data-mining application
with Twitter.  Good instructions for doing so can be found here:
http://marcobonzanini.com/2015/03/02/mining-twitter-data-with-python-part-1/

After doing this you can copy and paste your unique consumer key,
consumer secret, access token, and access secret into the load_api()
function below.

The main() function can be run by executing the command: 
python twitter_search.py

We used Python 3 and tweepy version 3.5.0.  You will also need the other
packages imported above.
